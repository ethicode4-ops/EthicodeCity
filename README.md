# Ethicode City

## Game Features
The game begins in a city devastated by unforeseen circumstances. The previous mayor has been arrested, leaving the new mayor (the player) responsible for rebuilding the city from scratch. With the help of the city’s architect, the player must not only rebuild but also uncover the reasons behind the city’s collapse.

### Architect's Instructions
#### Introduction:
- “You are this city's new mayor and have to build it again as, due to some unforeseen circumstances, the entire city has collapsed, and the old mayor has been arrested. We need to find out why the city collapsed and build the city from scratch.”

#### Building Instructions:
- “These are the available buildings which can be built. The government has allotted you $1000, and you need to build the city. The time taken by each building and their costs are shown below them.”

#### Factories and AI Tokens:
- “These are the factories that should be built. As you build more factories, they will generate AI tokens that can be used to reduce the time required to construct other buildings. However, these tokens come with their risks and consequences.”

#### Ethics System:
- “As you progress and build various parts of the city, you will encounter different ethics displayed on the right side of the screen. Collecting these ethics will earn you reward points, which can unlock more buildings. The game ends once all the ethics are found.”

### Ethics Incorporated
- **Code Documentation**
- **Well Commented Code**
- **AI-Generated Code**
- **Code Breaching**
- **Code Testing and Quality**

## Gameplay Mechanics

### AI and Banks
- Building a bank with AI takes only 1 second (compared to 200 seconds without AI) to entice players.
- Banks built with AI may face code breaches, leading to robberies, represented by a danger symbol after completion.
- The bank generates revenue for the city, adding $100 to the mayor’s account every 10 seconds.

### Natural Disasters
- After constructing a minimum number of buildings, a warning appears: “In nearby areas, an earthquake is detected and may affect your city soon.”
- During the earthquake, all buildings constructed with AI collapse, demonstrating they were not adequately tested or quality-assured.

### Citizen Happiness Meter
- A "Citizen Happiness Meter" reflects the happiness of the city’s citizens, which increases as more buildings are constructed.

### Factory Efficiency and Code Commenting
- Factories operate at 50% efficiency if the code is not well-commented.
- Players must play a mini-game (Debugging Challenge) to improve efficiency.
- Example snippets for players to comment:
  - **Code:** `totalTokens = productionRate * 2;`  
    **Player Comment:** “Calculate the total AI tokens generated based on production rate.”
  - **Code:** `if (powerSupply < 50) { shutdownFactory(); }`  
    **Player Comment:** “If the power supply is less than 50%, shut down the factory to prevent damage.”
- Upon providing valid comments, the system acknowledges: “Ok, well commented, your factory efficiency has improved by 25%.”

## Key Features Summary

### Gameplay Elements
- Rebuild the city using a limited budget.
- Utilize AI tokens with caution due to associated risks.
- Manage ethics, citizen happiness, and documentation.

### Mini-Games and Challenges
